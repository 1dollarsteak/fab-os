# fab-os
My own OS based on the document at [cs.bham.ac.uk opsys](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf). Really great read, although not finished. Hope I can poke my way through VGA.

Continuing with a new source I've found at [brokenthorn](http://www.brokenthorn.com/Resources/OSDevIndex.html).
